# Debugging

WarpDrive ships with comprehensive instrumented logging throughout its internals. All instrumentation is **stripped from production builds** — enabling it has zero production cost.

Logging is regionalized by concern so you can enable only the areas relevant to your investigation.

## Quick Start

Open your browser's DevTools console and call:

```ts
setWarpDriveLogging({ LOG_REQUESTS: true, LOG_CACHE: true })
```

No import needed — the helper is attached to `globalThis` automatically.

## Runtime Activation

::: tip 💡 Works directly in browser DevTools
No import required. Config is preserved across page reloads via `sessionStorage`.
:::

```ts
setWarpDriveLogging({
  LOG_REQUESTS: true,
  LOG_CACHE: true,
  LOG_NOTIFICATIONS: true,
})
```

Settings persist for the current browser tab only. Open a new tab (or call the helper with the flag set to `false`) to reset.

## Build-time Activation

To enable logging by default in a dev environment, use the build config:

```ts
setConfig(__dirname, app, {
  debug: {
    LOG_REQUESTS: true,
    LOG_CACHE: true,
  }
});
```

All flags default to `false`. Runtime activation via `setWarpDriveLogging` overrides build-time values for the current tab.

## Log Flags

### Requests

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_REQUESTS` | All requests issued by the RequestManager |
| `LOG_REQUEST_STATUS` | Status updates for in-flight network requests |

### Cache

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_CACHE` | All cache updates — both local and remote state |
| `LOG_CACHE_POLICY` | Decisions made by the cache policy (e.g. whether to refetch) |
| `LOG_NOTIFICATIONS` | Notifications received by the NotificationManager |

### Relationships

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_GRAPH` | Updates to the relationship graph (pointer storage) |
| `DEBUG_RELATIONSHIP_NOTIFICATIONS` | Cause of change notifications when processing `hasMany` updates |

### Records & Identity

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_IDENTIFIERS` | Peek, generation, and updates to Record Identifiers |
| `LOG_INSTANCE_CACHE` | Creation and removal of RecordData and Record instances |

### Reactivity

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_REACT_SIGNAL_INTEGRATION` | React-specific reactivity events |

### Performance

| Flag | What it logs |
|------|-------------|
| `LOG_METRIC_COUNTS` | Key count metrics useful for performance profiling |

## Deprecated Flags

These flags were removed in v5.5. They have no effect — use `LOG_CACHE` instead.

| Removed flag | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `LOG_MUTATIONS` | `LOG_CACHE` |
| `LOG_OPERATIONS` | `LOG_CACHE` |
| `LOG_PAYLOADS` | `LOG_CACHE` |
