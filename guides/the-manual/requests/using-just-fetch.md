# Using "Just Fetch"

Throughout this guide we've shown usage of the `RequestManager` in context of a `Store`.

::: code-group

```ts [Setup]
import { Store, CacheHandler, RequestManager, Fetch } from '@warp-drive/core';

export default class AppStore extends Store {

  requestManager = new RequestManager()
    .use([Fetch])
    .useCache(CacheHandler);

}
```

```ts [Usage]
store.request({ url: '/users' })
```

:::

This is because most applications will want access to features only available when
using the store such as reactive-data, advanced caching, and relational mapping.

Out of the box, the entire ***Warp*Drive** experience is optimized to be small and
fast. However, if all your application needs is a pipeline to help you manage requests
in a conventional way (or that plus reactive promise states / reactive control flow) then
its possible to use an even more minimal ***Warp*Drive** setup.

This guide covers how to do so.

## Creating a RequestManager Without a Store

A [RequestManager](/api/@warp-drive/core/classes/RequestManager) does not need a `Store`, and
it is not specific to any library or framework. On its own it does not know how to fulfill a
request, so register at least one handler with
[use](/api/@warp-drive/core/classes/RequestManager#use). The
[Fetch](/api/@warp-drive/core/variables/Fetch) handler executes `fetch` with the request
options you give it.

Most apps need only one manager. Create it once and export it from a module:

```ts [app/fetch.ts]
import { RequestManager, Fetch } from '@warp-drive/core';

const manager = new RequestManager().use([Fetch]);

export default manager;
```

Then make requests with it the same way you would with `store.request`:

```ts
import manager from './fetch';

const { content } = await manager.request({ url: '/api/users' });
```

The request accepts the same [request options](./index.md#request-options) as `store.request`,
and [builders](./builders.md) work with it too. The `Future` it returns has the same `abort()`
and `getStream()` described in [Using The Response](./using-the-response.md), and you can pass
it to `getRequestState` for [reactive control flow](./index.md#reactive-control-flow).

```ts
const future = manager.request({ url: '/api/users' });

// later, if the result is no longer needed
future.abort();
```

see [Basic Usage](../cookbook/basic-usage.md) in the Cookbook.

## What You Give Up Without the Store

Without a `Store` there is no cache, so:

- `content` is whatever the last handler in the chain returns. For `Fetch` that is the response
  body parsed as JSON, not a [ReactiveDocument](/api/@warp-drive/core/reactive/types/ReactiveDocument).
- Requests are never deduplicated or resolved from the cache, however often you make them.

This also applies when the same `RequestManager` is shared with a `Store`, including calling
`store.requestManager.request` directly. The `CacheHandler` only handles requests that carry a
`store`, and `store.request` is what adds it. Requests made directly with `manager.request`
pass through the `CacheHandler` untouched, as described in
[Determining If A Request Can Use The Cache](../caching/index.md#determining-if-a-request-can-use-the-cache).

## Writing Your Own Handlers

Any handler you register with `use` runs for a standalone manager just as it does for a
`Store`'s manager.

- [Handlers](./handlers.md) shows how to write one that transforms a response.
- [Auth Handlers](../cookbook/auth-handlers.md) shows how to add an auth header to every
  request.
- [Advanced Handlers](./handlers-advanced.md) covers the `RequestContext` API, retrying
  errors, handling abort and passing streams along the chain.
