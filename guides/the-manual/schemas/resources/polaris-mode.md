# PolarisMode (preview)

:::tip 💡 **PolarisMode is not yet recommended**
Currently we recommend apps use [LegacyMode](./legacy-mode.md). PolarisMode is currently in
preview and will become the recommendation in V6.
:::

PolarisMode will become the default recommendation for new apps beginning in V6. It is currently
in preview.

## Feature Overview

In PolarisMode:

- ReactiveResources are immutable (unless explicitly newly created or checked out for editing)
- The mode changes how mutations are handled, local changes will only show where you want them to on the editable version of a record, while the immutable version will never show local changes.
- The mode removes the API cruft Model had accumulated (references, state props, currentState, methods etc)
- ~~The mode enables deep reactivity for fields~~ (we have now enabled this for LegacyMode)
- ~~enables advanced derivations, aliasing and transformations~~ (we have now enabled this for LegacyMode)
- **[preview limitation]** it has very limited support for relationships (see [LinksMode](../../misc/links-mode.md) for additional context)
- **[preview limitation]** it has no access to reactive properties describing the resource state (such as `isNew` or `isDirty`) or utilities for working with local state like `rollback`
- Async relationships are not wrapped in promise proxies, and there is no autofetch.
