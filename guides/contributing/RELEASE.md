title: Performing A Release

# Release

The WarpDrive release process is mostly automated but requires manually configuring
and triggering the appropriate workflow.

There are four standard and two non-standard release channels

- standard releases: `lts`, `release`, `beta`, `canary`.
- non-standard releases: `lts-prev` `release-prev`

## Before We Start

Before we begin the release train, make sure that the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) is properly
updated on `main` and `beta` so that it will be accurate when the new release branch is
created. To do this you likely need to reach out to WarpDrive core team members to ensure
all recent planning discussions and work is properly accounted for.

## Getting Setup To Do A Release

In order to release WarpDrive you must have commit rights to `warp-drive-data/warp-drive` on
GitHub, along with permission to trigger the `0. Release` workflow. Everything else is handled
by automation.

Publishing to npm requires npm's [Trusted Publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/)
(OIDC), which is only available from within that GitHub Actions workflow -- there is no manual
or local publish path, and no npm account, access token, or 2FA setup is needed to perform a
release. For more information run `bun release about` in the repository.

If you want to run a release step locally for review (e.g. a `--dry-run`, or generating a
release strategy) rather than actually publishing, you will additionally need:

- `bun`, `pnpm` and `node` installed globally (or better, via `mise`)
- A `GITHUB_AUTH` token configured for `lerna-changelog`, to gather info for the release notes

## Release Order

When releasing more than one channel, we release from "most stable" to "least stable".
This is what allows changes to flow down from canary to lts versioned seamlessly.

- `lts` (_Most Stable_)
- `release`
- `beta`
- `canary` (_Least Stable_)

Since non-standard releases are always bespoke, they do not participate in the above flow.

You will find the automated workflows to perform these releases under the actions tab on github.

## Polish the Release!

First, update the Release Notes on Github

- Visit [WarpDrive Releases](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/releases)
  - Click on the "more recent tags"
  - Click on the tag just published
  - Edit the tag, adding a meaningful title and attaching the changelog (see other releases for examples)
  - Publish the release!
  - Only set the release as latest if it should be the `latest` tag on npm as well (e.g. the `release` channel). LTS/Beta/Canary/LTS-prev/Release-prev should never be marked as `latest`.

Once you have finished this release process, we recommend posting an announcement to your
Threads/Mastadon/Twitter accounts and them crosslinking the announcement to the following
