description: Create a todo with one request, and let cache invalidation refetch every todo list for you.

# Create

Type a todo and press Enter. The input clears, but nothing is saved. Let's write
the request, and watch the lists update themselves.

## Write the builder

Create a new file, `app/data/builders/create.ts`:

```ts
import type { ReactiveDataDocument } from '@warp-drive/core/reactive';
import { withReactiveResponse } from '@warp-drive/core/request';
import type { RequestInfo } from '@warp-drive/core/types/request';
import { buildBaseURL } from '@warp-drive/utilities';

import type { Todo, TodoAttributes } from '../schemas/todo.ts';

/** POST /api/todo */
export function createTodo(attributes: TodoAttributes): RequestInfo<ReactiveDataDocument<Todo>> {
  return withReactiveResponse<Todo>({
    method: 'POST',
    url: buildBaseURL({ resourcePath: 'todo' }),
    body: JSON.stringify({ data: { type: 'todo', attributes } }),

    // Invalidates every cached 'todo' query, so lists refetch with the new todo.
    op: 'createRecord',
    cacheOptions: { types: ['todo'] },
  });
}
```

`TodoAttributes`, from the schema file, is a todo's fields. The body is a
JSON:API document without an `id`, because the server assigns one. The last two
lines are the important part: when a `createRecord` request succeeds, the store
invalidates every request registered for the types in its `cacheOptions.types`.
Here that's all three lists from chapter 3.

## Send it

In `app/components/todo-app/create-todo.gts`, `onSubmit` reads the form into
`attributes` and resets it, but saves nothing in between. Send the request
there:

```ts
await this.store.request(createTodo(attributes));
```

Import the builder:

```ts
import { createTodo } from '#app/data/builders/create.ts';
```

## Check it

Add a todo. It appears at the bottom, and the footer count goes up. Nothing in
the component touched the list. Here's what did:

```
store.request(createTodo(...))
  │
  ▼
POST /api/todo ──► 201, the saved todo
  │
  ▼
the cache stores the new todo
  │
  ▼
the store invalidates every request registered for 'todo':
  GET /api/todo                          the list
  GET /api/todo?filter[completed]=false  the footer count
  GET /api/todo?filter[completed]=true   "Clear completed"
  │
  ▼
each <Request @autorefresh={{true}}> sees its request invalidated
and fetches it again
```

Each `<Request>` keeps the old list on screen until the new one arrives. That's
one `POST` and a `GET` per list, and the server stays in charge of what each
list holds.

Without invalidation, the form would need to know every list on the page and
refresh each one. It knows about none of them.

See [Mutations](../../the-manual/mutations/index.md) for more on saving data.

## What's next

You can create todos but not change them. Chapter 5 edits a title.
