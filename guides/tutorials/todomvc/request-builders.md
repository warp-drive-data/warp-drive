# Request builders

Chapter 1 wrote the todo request three times, spelling out the URL and the
response type each time, and the footer needs three more. Let's write it once,
as a builder. By the end of this chapter the whole footer works.

A request is just an object, so a **builder** is a plain function that returns
one. It sends nothing. You pass its result to `store.request`, or to
`<Request>`.

## Write the builders

Create a new file, `app/data/builders/query.ts`:

```ts
import { withReactiveResponse } from '@warp-drive/core/request';
import type { RequestInfo } from '@warp-drive/core/types/request';
import { buildBaseURL, buildQueryParams } from '@warp-drive/utilities';

import type { Todo, TodosDocument } from '../schemas/todo.ts';

function queryTodos(filter?: { completed: boolean }): RequestInfo<TodosDocument> {
  const url = buildBaseURL({ resourcePath: 'todo' });
  const query = filter ? `?${buildQueryParams({ 'filter[completed]': filter.completed })}` : '';

  return withReactiveResponse<Todo[]>({
    method: 'GET',
    url: `${url}${query}`,
    headers: new Headers({ Accept: 'application/vnd.api+json' }),

    // 'query' requests for the 'todo' type are invalidated whenever a todo is
    // created, so every list refetches and picks up the new todo.
    op: 'query',
    cacheOptions: { types: ['todo'] },
  });
}

/** GET /api/todo */
export function getAllTodos(): RequestInfo<TodosDocument> {
  return queryTodos();
}

/** GET /api/todo?filter[completed]=false */
export function getActiveTodos(): RequestInfo<TodosDocument> {
  return queryTodos({ completed: false });
}

/** GET /api/todo?filter[completed]=true */
export function getCompletedTodos(): RequestInfo<TodosDocument> {
  return queryTodos({ completed: true });
}
```

Each builder returns a `RequestInfo<TodosDocument>`: a request that will get a
`TodosDocument` back. Two helpers from `@warp-drive/utilities` build the URL:
`buildBaseURL` makes the `/api/todo` path, and `buildQueryParams` adds the
filter.

Two lines do more than build a URL:

- `withReactiveResponse<Todo[]>` records the response type on the request, so
  callers don't have to. Chapter 1 wrote `store.request<TodosDocument>` for that.
- `op: 'query'` with `cacheOptions: { types: ['todo'] }` registers the request
  as a list of todos. When a todo is created, the store **invalidates** every
  such request: it marks the cached response out of date, so `<Request>` fetches
  it again.

## Use them in the routes

In `app/routes/index.ts`, replace chapter 1's request with the builder:

```ts
import { getAllTodos } from '#app/data/builders/query.ts';

// ...

todos: this.store.request(getAllTodos()),
```

Do the same in `app/routes/active.ts` and `app/routes/completed.ts`, with
`getActiveTodos` and `getCompletedTodos`.

## Use them in the footer

Three parts of the footer need todos. Each passes a builder to `<Request>` as
`@query`, and `<Request>` calls `store.request` for you.

TodoMVC hides the footer when there are no todos. The footer can't use the
page's list to decide: on the Active page that list is filtered, and it can be
empty while completed todos still exist. So the footer asks the store for all
the todos itself, and shows only if there are any. In
`app/components/todo-app/footer.gts`, wrap the footer in that request:

```handlebars
<Request @query={{(getAllTodos)}} @autorefresh={{true}} @autorefreshBehavior="refresh">

  <:content as |content|>
    {{#if content.data.length}}
      <footer class="footer">
        {{yield}}
      </footer>
    {{/if}}
  </:content>

  <:error as |error|>
    <HandleError @error={{error}} />
  </:error>

</Request>
```

In `app/components/todo-app/todo-count.gts`, count the active todos:

```handlebars
<Request @query={{(getActiveTodos)}} @autorefresh={{true}} @autorefreshBehavior="refresh">
  <:content as |content|>
    <Remaining @remaining={{content.data.length}} />
  </:content>
  <:error as |error|>
    <HandleError @error={{error}} @toast="Could not get active todos for Todo Remaining Count." />
  </:error>
</Request>
```

In `app/components/todo-app/clear-completed-todos.gts`, hand the completed todos
to the button:

```handlebars
<Request @query={{(getCompletedTodos)}} @autorefresh={{true}} @autorefreshBehavior="refresh">
  <:content as |content|>
    <ClearCompleted @completed={{content.data}} />
  </:content>
  <:error as |error|>
    <HandleError @error={{error}} @toast="Could not get completed todos for 'Clear Completed'." />
  </:error>
</Request>
```

Import each builder at the top of its file. `(getAllTodos)` calls the builder
from the template.

The footer asks for the same list as the `index` route, and the Network panel
shows one `GET /api/todo`, not two. The store recognizes the same request and
answers both from one response.

## Check it

Reload. The footer says "2 items left" and shows "Clear completed", because one
of the three todos is done.

## Move the headers into a handler

Every request from here on needs the JSON:API headers. You could repeat them in
every builder, but then each new builder has to remember them, and one that
forgets breaks against a strict JSON:API server. Instead, let's add them once,
on the path every request takes: a handler. Create a new file,
`app/data/handlers/json-api.ts`:

```ts
import type { Future, Handler, NextFn } from '@warp-drive/core/request';
import type { RequestContext } from '@warp-drive/core/types/request';

const JSON_API = 'application/vnd.api+json';

/** Adds the JSON:API content negotiation headers to every request. */
export const JsonApiHandler: Handler = {
  request<T>(context: RequestContext, next: NextFn<T>): Future<T> {
    const headers = new Headers(context.request.headers);
    headers.set('Accept', JSON_API);
    headers.set('Content-Type', JSON_API);
    return next(Object.assign({}, context.request, { headers }));
  },
};
```

A handler gets the request as `context.request` and passes it on with `next`.
This one passes on a copy with the two headers set.

The store runs every request through the handlers you list, in order, and then
`Fetch` sends it. To act on only some requests, a handler checks
`context.request` itself. For example, a handler that adds an auth token only
to your own API's requests checks `context.request.url`, and passes every other
request straight to `next`.

Add it to the store's `handlers` in `app/data/store.ts`:

```ts
import { JsonApiHandler } from './handlers/json-api.ts';

// ...

handlers: [JsonApiHandler],
```

Then delete the `headers` line from `queryTodos`. Reload, and the requests in the
Network panel now carry both headers.

See [Builders](../../the-manual/requests/builders.md) and
[Handlers](../../the-manual/requests/handlers.md) in the manual.

## What's next

Nothing writes to the API yet. In chapter 4 you create a todo, and every list
updates without being told.
