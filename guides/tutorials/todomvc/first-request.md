# First request

The list is empty because nothing asks the API for todos. Let's fix that. By the
end of this chapter three todos are on screen, and every filter works.

In ***Warp*Drive** you don't ask for a model. You describe a **request** (a URL
and some options) and hand it to the **store**, which every request goes
through. The store returns a **Future** right away: a promise that also knows
whether it's loading, done or failed. It resolves to a **document**, the whole
response, with the records you asked for in its `data`. The store keeps what it
receives in its **cache**, and the records are **reactive**: templates showing
them update when the cache changes.

## Request the todos

The route for the main list, `app/routes/index.ts`, returns an empty model. Have
its `model()` hook ask the store for the todos:

```ts
model(): { todos?: Future<TodosDocument> } {
  return {
    todos: this.store.request<TodosDocument>({ url: '/api/todo' }),
  };
}
```

The route doesn't wait for the response. It hands the `Future` to the page,
which decides what to show while it loads.

`TodosDocument` is the response's type. The starter defines it in
`app/data/schemas/todo.ts` as `ReactiveDataDocument<Todo[]>`: a document whose
`data` is a list of reactive todos. For now you pass it by hand; in chapter 3
the request carries its own type.

The Active and Completed pages have routes of their own. Have each ask for its
part of the list:

```ts
// app/routes/active.ts
todos: this.store.request<TodosDocument>({ url: '/api/todo?filter[completed]=false' }),

// app/routes/completed.ts
todos: this.store.request<TodosDocument>({ url: '/api/todo?filter[completed]=true' }),
```

That's the same request three times, with the URL and the type spelled out in
each. Chapter 3 fixes that.

## Render the response

The `Future` reaches `app/components/todo-app/todo-provider.gts` as
`@todoFuture`, and its template renders nothing yet. Render the `Future` with a
`<Request>` block:

```handlebars
<Request @request={{@todoFuture}} @autorefresh={{true}} @autorefreshBehavior="refresh">

  <:loading><LoadingSpinner /></:loading>

  <:content as |content|>
    <TodoListState @todos={{content.data}}>
      <:toggle as |list|>{{yield list to="toggle"}}</:toggle>
      <:list as |list|>{{yield list to="list"}}</:list>
    </TodoListState>
  </:content>

  <:error as |error|>{{this.appState.onUnrecoverableError error}}</:error>

</Request>
```

`<Request>` takes the `Future` and renders `<:loading>`, `<:content>` or
`<:error>`, depending on where the request is. The todos are `content.data`. The
two `@autorefresh` arguments refetch in the background when the store marks the
response out of date, which chapter 4 relies on.

Without ***Warp*Drive**, every component that fetches tracks its own loading and
error state. Here the `Future` carries that state, and `<Request>` renders it.

## Check it

Reload. Three todos. Click Active, then Completed: each shows its part of the
list.

<img src="../../images/tutorials/todomvc/first-request.png" alt="Three todos in the list, over a footer with only the All, Active and Completed filters" width="100%">

The footer's count and "Clear completed" are still empty, and nothing saves yet.
Each chapter adds a piece.

Next, a short look at why that took so little code.
