# @ember-data/store

:::warning ⚠️ Legacy Package
**This package only exists for backwards compatibility.**

Use {@link @warp-drive/core! | @warp-drive/core} instead.
:::

This package provides [*Ember***Data**](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/)'s `Store` class.

A {@link Store} coordinates interaction between your application, a {@link Cache},
and sources of data (such as your API or a local persistence layer) accessed via a {@link RequestManager}.

Optionally, a Store can be configured to hydrate the response data into rich presentation classes.

## Creating A Store

To use a `Store` we will need to do few things: add a {@link Cache}
to store data **in-memory**, add a {@link Handler} to fetch data from a source,
and implement `instantiateRecord` to tell the store how to display the data for individual resources.

:::tip Note
If you are using the package `ember-data` then a JSON:API cache, RequestManager, LegacyNetworkHandler,
and `instantiateRecord` are configured for you by default.
:::

### Configuring A Cache

To start, let's install a [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org/) cache. If your app uses `GraphQL` or `REST` other
caches may better fit your data. You can author your own cache by creating one that
conforms to the {@link Cache | spec}.

The package `@ember-data/json-api` provides a [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org/) cache we can use.
After installing it, we can configure the store to use this cache.

```js
import Store from '@ember-data/store';
import Cache from '@ember-data/json-api';

class extends Store {
  createCache(storeWrapper) {
    return new Cache(storeWrapper);
  }
}
```

Now that we have a `cache` let's setup something to handle fetching
and saving data via our API.

:::tip Note
The `ember-data` package automatically includes and configures
the `@ember-data/json-api` cache for you.
:::

### Handling Requests

When *Ember***Data** needs to fetch or save data it will pass that request to your application's `RequestManager` for fulfillment. How this fulfillment occurs (in-memory, device storage, via single or multiple API requests, etc.) is then up to the registered request handlers.

To start, let's install the `RequestManager` from `@ember-data/request` and the basic `Fetch` handler from `@ember-data/request/fetch`.

:::tip Note
If your app uses `GraphQL`, `REST` or different conventions for `JSON:API` than your cache expects, other handlers may better fit your data. You can author your own handler by creating one that conforms to the [handler interface](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/tree/main/packages/request#handling-requests).
:::

```ts
import Store from '@ember-data/store';
import RequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
import Fetch from '@ember-data/request/fetch';

export default class extends Store {
  requestManager = new RequestManager()
   .use([Fetch]);
}
```

**Using RequestManager as a Service**

Alternatively if you have configured the `RequestManager` to be a service you may re-use it.

*app/services/request.js*
```ts
import RequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
import Fetch from '@ember-data/request/fetch';

export default {
  create() {
    return new RequestManager()
      .use([Fetch])
      .useCache(CacheHandler);
  }
}
```

*app/services/store.js*
```ts
import Store from '@ember-data/store';
import { service } from '@ember/service';

export default class extends Store {
  @service('request') requestManager
}
```

### Presenting Data from the Cache

Now that we have a source and a cache for our data, we need to configure how
the Store delivers that data back to our application. We do this via the {@link Store.instantiateRecord | instantiateRecord hook}
which allows us to transform the data for a resource before handing it to the application.

A naive way to present the data would be to return it as JSON. Typically instead
this hook will be used to add reactivity and make each unique resource a singleton,
ensuring that if the cache updates our presented data will reflect the new state.

Below is an example of using the hooks `instantiateRecord` and a `teardownRecord`
to provide minimal read-only reactive state for simple resources.

```ts
import Store, { recordIdentifierFor } from '@ember-data/store';
import { TrackedObject } from 'tracked-built-ins';

class extends Store {
  instantiateRecord(identifier) {
    const { cache, notifications } = this;

    // create a TrackedObject with our attributes, id and type
    const record = new TrackedObject(Object.assign({}, cache.peek(identifier)));
    record.type = identifier.type;
    record.id = identifier.id;

    notifications.subscribe(identifier, (_, change) => {
      if (change === 'attributes') {
        Object.assign(record, cache.peek(identifier));
      }
    });

    return record;
  }
}
```

Because `instantiateRecord` is opaque to the nature of the record, an implementation
can be anything from a fairly simple object to a robust proxy that intelligently links
together associated records through relationships.

This also enables creating a record that separates `edit` flows from `create` flows
entirely. A record class might choose to implement a `checkout` method that gives access
to an editable instance while the primary record continues to be read-only and reflect
only persisted (non-mutated) state.

Typically you will choose an existing record implementation such as `@ember-data/model`
for your application.

Because of the boundaries around instantiation and the cache, record implementations
should be capable of interop both with each other and with any `Cache`. Due to this,
if needed an application can utilize multiple record implementations and multiple cache
implementations either to support enhanced features for only a subset of records or to
be able to incrementally migrate from one record/cache to another record or cache.

:::tip Note
The `ember-data` package automatically includes the `@ember-data/model`
package and configures it for you.
