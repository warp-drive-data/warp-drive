⚠️ **This is LEGACY documentation** for a feature that is no longer encouraged to be used.
If starting a new app or thinking of implementing a new adapter, consider writing a
Handler instead to be used with the [RequestManager](../../../core/classes/RequestManager.md)
:::

The following documentation describes the methods an application
serializer should implement with descriptions around when an
application might expect these methods to be called.

Methods that are not required are marked as **optional**.

## Methods

### destroy()?

```ts
optional destroy(): void;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:256](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L256)

**`Optional`**

In some situations the serializer may need to perform cleanup when destroyed,
that cleanup can be done in `destroy`.

If not implemented, the store does not inform the serializer of destruction.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### normalize()?

```ts
optional normalize(
   schema, 
   rawPayload, 
   prop?
): SingleResourceDocument;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:164](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L164)

**`Optional`**

This method is intended to normalize data into a [JSON:API Document](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure)
with a data member containing a single [Resource](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects).

* `type` should be formatted in the singular, dasherized and lowercase form
* `members` (the property names of attributes and relationships) should be formatted
  to match their definition in the corresponding `Model` definition. Typically this
  will be `camelCase`.
* [`lid`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0403-ember-data-identifiers.md) is
  a valid optional sibling to `id` and `type` in both [Resources](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects)
  and [Resource Identifier Objects](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-identifier-objects)

This method is called by the `Store` when `store.normalize(modelName, payload)` is
called. It is recommended to use `store.serializerFor(modelName).normalizeResponse`
over `store.normalize`.

This method may be called when also using the `RESTSerializer`
when `serializer.pushPayload` is called by `store.pushPayload`.
However, it is recommended to use `store.push` over `store.pushPayload` after normalizing
the payload directly.

Example:

```js
function pushPayload(store, modelName, rawPayload) {
  const ModelClass = store.modelFor(modelName);
  const serializer = store.serializerFor(modelName);
  const jsonApiPayload = serializer.normalizeResponse(store, ModelClass, rawPayload, null, 'query');

  return store.push(jsonApiPayload);
}
```

This method may be called when also using the `JSONAPISerializer`
when normalizing included records. If mixing serializer usage in this way
we recommend implementing this method, but caution that it may lead
to unexpected mixing of formats.

This method may also be called when normalizing embedded relationships when
using the `EmbeddedRecordsMixin`. If using this mixin in a serializer in
your application we recommend implementing this method, but caution that
it may lead to unexpected mixing of formats.

#### Parameters

##### schema

`ModelSchema`

An object with methods for accessing information about
the type, attributes and relationships of the primary type associated with the request.

##### rawPayload

[`ObjectValue`](../../../core/types/json/raw/interfaces/ObjectValue.md)

Some raw JSON data to be normalized into a JSON:API Resource.

##### prop?

`string`

When called by the EmbeddedRecordsMixin this param will be the
property at which the object provided as rawPayload was found.

#### Returns

[`SingleResourceDocument`](../../../core/types/spec/json-api-raw/type-aliases/SingleResourceDocument.md)

A JSON:API Document containing a single JSON:API Resource as its primary data.

### normalizeResponse()

```ts
normalizeResponse(
   store, 
   schema, 
   rawPayload, 
   id, 
   requestType
): JsonApiDocument;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:78](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L78)

This method is responsible for normalizing the value resolved from the promise returned
by an Adapter request into the format expected by the `Store`.

The output should be a [JSON:API Document](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure)
with the following additional restrictions:

* `type` should be formatted in the `singular` `dasherized` `lowercase` form
* `members` (the property names of attributes and relationships) should be formatted
  to match their definition in the corresponding `Model` definition. Typically this
  will be `camelCase`.
* [`lid`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0403-ember-data-identifiers.md) is
  a valid optional sibling to `id` and `type` in both [Resources](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects)
  and [Resource Identifier Objects](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-identifier-objects)

#### Parameters

##### store

`Store$1`

The store service that initiated the request being normalized

##### schema

`ModelSchema`

An object with methods for accessing information about
the type, attributes and relationships of the primary type associated with the request.

##### rawPayload

[`AdapterPayload`](../type-aliases/AdapterPayload.md)

The raw JSON response data returned from an API request.
This correlates to the value the promise returned by the adapter method that performed
the request resolved to.

##### id

`string` | `null`

For a findRecord request, this is the id initially provided
in the call to store.findRecord. Else this value is null.

##### requestType

| `"findRecord"`
| `"queryRecord"`
| `"findAll"`
| `"findBelongsTo"`
| `"findHasMany"`
| `"findMany"`
| `"query"`
| `"createRecord"`
| `"deleteRecord"`
| `"updateRecord"`

The type of request the Adapter had been asked to perform.

#### Returns

`JsonApiDocument`

a document following the structure of a [{json:api} Document](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure).

***

### pushPayload()?

```ts
optional pushPayload(store, rawPayload): void;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:245](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L245)

**`Optional`**

This method allows for normalization of data when `store.pushPayload` is called
and should be implemented if you want to use that method.

The method is responsible for pushing new data to the store using `store.push`
once any necessary normalization has occurred, and no data in the store will be
updated unless it does so.

The normalized form pushed to the store should be a [JSON:API Document](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure)
with the following additional restrictions:

* `type` should be formatted in the singular, dasherized and lowercase form
* `members` (the property names of attributes and relationships) should be formatted
  to match their definition in the corresponding `Model` definition. Typically this
  will be `camelCase`.
* [`lid`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0403-ember-data-identifiers.md) is
  a valid optional sibling to `id` and `type` in both [Resources](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects)
  and [Resource Identifier Objects](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-identifier-objects)

If you need better control over normalization or want access to the records being added or updated
in the store, we recommended using `store.push` over `store.pushPayload` after normalizing
the payload directly. This can even take advantage of an existing serializer for the format
the data is in, for example:

```js
function pushPayload(store, modelName, rawPayload) {
  const ModelClass = store.modelFor(modelName);
  const serializer = store.serializerFor(modelName);
  const jsonApiPayload = serializer.normalizeResponse(store, ModelClass, rawPayload, null, 'query');

  return store.push(jsonApiPayload);
}
```

#### Parameters

##### store

`Store$1`

The store service that initiated the request being normalized

##### rawPayload

[`ObjectValue`](../../../core/types/json/raw/interfaces/ObjectValue.md)

The raw JSON response data returned from an API request.
This JSON should be in the API format expected by the serializer.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### serialize()

```ts
serialize(snapshot, options?): ObjectValue;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:111](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L111)

This method is responsible for serializing an individual record
via a Snapshot into the format expected by the API.

This method is called by `snapshot.serialize()`.

When using `Model`, this method is called by `record.serialize()`.

When using `JSONAPIAdapter` or `RESTAdapter` this method is called
by `updateRecord` and `createRecord` if `Serializer.serializeIntoHash`
is not implemented.

#### Parameters

##### snapshot

`Snapshot`

A Snapshot for the record to serialize

##### options?

[`SerializerOptions`](../type-aliases/SerializerOptions.md)

#### Returns

[`ObjectValue`](../../../core/types/json/raw/interfaces/ObjectValue.md)

***

### serializeIntoHash()?

```ts
optional serializeIntoHash(
   hash, 
   schema, 
   snapshot, 
   options?
): void;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts:203](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b6590b8852e5d32b32e3eece336d0f892e8b02a5/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/legacy-network-handler/minimum-serializer-interface.ts#L203)

**`Optional`**

When using `JSONAPIAdapter` or `RESTAdapter` this method is called
by `adapter.updateRecord` and `adapter.createRecord` if `serializer.serializeIntoHash`
is implemented. If this method is not implemented, `serializer.serialize`
will be called in this case.

You can use this method to customize the root keys serialized into the payload.
The hash property should be modified by reference.

For instance, your API may expect resources to be keyed by underscored type in the payload:

```js
{
  _user: {
    type: 'user',
    id: '1'
  }
}
```

Which when using these adapters can be achieved by implementing this method similar
to the following:

```js
serializeIntoHash(hash, ModelClass, snapshot, options) {
  hash[`_${snapshot.modelName}`] = this.serialize(snapshot, options).data;
}
```

#### Parameters

##### hash

`object`

A top most object of the request payload onto
which to append the serialized record

##### schema

`ModelSchema`

An object with methods for accessing information about
the type, attributes and relationships of the primary type associated with the request.

##### snapshot

`Snapshot`

A Snapshot for the record to serialize

##### options?

[`SerializerOptions`](../type-aliases/SerializerOptions.md)

#### Returns

`void`
