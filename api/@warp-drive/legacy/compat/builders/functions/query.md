# &#x20;~~query()~~

## Call Signature&#x20;

```ts
function query<T>(
   type, 
   query, 
   options?
): QueryRequestInput<TypeFromInstance<T>, T[]>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/builders/query.ts:38](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/3f489eba2a77cd849b03466a28c2ff1c9f5c97b6/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/compat/builders/query.ts#L38)

This function builds a request config for a given type and query object.
When passed to `store.request`, this config will result in the same behavior as a `store.query` request.
Additionally, it takes the same options as `store.query`.

All `@warp-drive/legacy/compat` builders exist to enable you to migrate your codebase to using the correct syntax for `store.request` while temporarily preserving legacy behaviors.
This is useful for quickly upgrading an entire app to a unified syntax while a longer incremental migration is made to shift off of adapters and serializers.
To that end, these builders are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of WarpDrive.

### Type Parameters
