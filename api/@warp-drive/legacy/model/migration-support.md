This module provides support for migrating away from @warp-drive/legacy/model
to ReactiveResource from @warp-drive/core/reactive.

It includes:

* A `withDefaults` function to assist in creating a schema in LegacyMode
* A `registerDerivations` function to register the derivations necessary to support LegacyMode
* A `DelegatingSchemaService` that can be used to provide a schema service that works with both
  @warp-drive/legacy/model and @warp-drive/core/reactive simultaneously for migration purposes.
* A `WithLegacy` type util that can be used to create a type that includes the legacy
  properties and methods of a record.

Using LegacyMode features on a ReactiveResource *requires* the use of these derivations and schema
additions. LegacyMode is not intended to be a long-term solution, but rather a stepping stone
to assist in more rapidly adopting modern WarpDrive features.
