# Canary Features&#x20;

***Warp*Drive** allows users to test upcoming features that are implemented
but not yet activated in canary builds.

Typically these features represent work that carries higher risk of breaking
changes, or are not yet fully ready for production use.

Such features have their implementations guarded by a "feature flag", and the
flag is only activated once the core-data team is prepared to ship the work
in a canary release, beginning the process of it landing in a stable release.

### Installing Canary

::: warning To test a feature guarded behind a flag, you MUST be using a canary build.
:::

Canary builds are published to `npm` and can be installed using a precise tag
(such as `@warp-drive/core@5.6.0-alpha.1`) or by installing the latest dist-tag
published to the `canary` channel.

Because ***Warp*Drive** packages operate on a strict lockstep policy with each other,
you must install the matching canary version of all ***Warp*Drive** packages.

Below is an example of installing the latest canary version of all the core
packages that are part of the ***Warp*Drive** project when using EmberJS.

Add/remove packages from this list to match your project.

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -E @warp-drive/core@canary \
  @warp-drive/json-api@canary \
  @warp-drive/ember@canary;
```

```sh [npm]
npm add -E @warp-drive/core@canary \
  @warp-drive/json-api@canary \
  @warp-drive/ember@canary;
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add -E @warp-drive/core@canary \
  @warp-drive/json-api@canary \
  @warp-drive/ember@canary;
```

```sh [bun]
bun add --exact @warp-drive/core@canary \
  @warp-drive/json-api@canary \
  @warp-drive/ember@canary;
```

### Activating a Feature

Once you have installed canary, feature-flags can be activated at build-time

```ts
setConfig(app, __dirname, {
  features: {
    FEATURE_A: false, // utilize existing behavior
    FEATURE_B: true // utilize the new behavior
  }
})
```

by setting an environment variable:

```sh
# Activate a single flag
export WARP_DRIVE_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=SOME_FLAG;

# Activate multiple flags by separating with commas
export WARP_DRIVE_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=SOME_FLAG,OTHER_FLAG;

# Activate all flags
export WARP_DRIVE_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL;
```

::: warning To test a feature guarded behind a flag, you MUST be running a development build.

### Preparing a Project to use a Canary Feature

For most projects and features, simple version detection should be enough.

Using the provided version compatibility helpers from [embroider-macros](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/tree/main/packages/macros#readme)
the following can be done:

```js
if (macroCondition(dependencySatisfies('@warp-drive/core', '5.6'))) {
  // do thing
}
```

For more complex projects and migrations, configure [@warp-drive/core/build-config/babel-macros](../../core/build-config/babel-macros/index.md)

The current list of features used at build time for canary releases is defined below.

::: tip 💡 If empty there are no features currently gated by feature flags.
:::

The valid values are:

* `true` | The feature is **enabled** at all times, and cannot be disabled.
* `false` | The feature is **disabled** at all times, and cannot be enabled.
* `null` | The feature is **disabled by default**, but can be enabled via configuration.

* [ENFORCE\_STRICT\_RESOURCE\_FINALIZATION](variables/ENFORCE_STRICT_RESOURCE_FINALIZATION.md)
* [JSON\_API\_CACHE\_VALIDATION\_ERRORS](variables/JSON_API_CACHE_VALIDATION_ERRORS.md)
