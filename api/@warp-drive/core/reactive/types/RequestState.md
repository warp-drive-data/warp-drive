Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:638](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/7afdd9818145634b9681a2bdd0f8c5cba16d9d9c/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L638)

RequestState extends the concept of [PromiseState](PromiseState.md) to provide a reactive
wrapper for a request [Future](../../request/types/Future.md) which allows you write declarative code
around a Future's control flow.

It is useful in both Template and JavaScript contexts, allowing you
to quickly derive behaviors and data from pending, error and success
states.

The key difference between a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and a Future is that Futures provide
access to a [stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) of their content, the RequestKey of the request (if any)
as well as the ability to attempt to [abort](../../request/types/Future.md#abort) the request.

```ts
interface Future<T> extends Promise<T>> {
  getStream(): Promise<ReadableStream>;
  abort(): void;
  lid: RequestKey | null;
}
```

These additional APIs allow us to craft even richer state experiences.

To get the state of a request, use [getRequestState](../functions/getRequestState.md).
