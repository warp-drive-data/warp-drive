Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:374](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/61394c6234e8cd5b736138b64ac29fdf3ec888d2/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L374)

The state of a request in the "fulfilled" state.
This is the state of a request that has resolved
successfully.

Extends the [ResolvedPromise](ResolvedPromise.md) interface.

## Extends

* [`ResolvedPromise`](ResolvedPromise.md)<`RT`>

## Type Parameters

### RT

`RT`

## Methods

### refresh()

```ts
refresh(usePolicy?: boolean): Future<RT>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:410](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/61394c6234e8cd5b736138b64ac29fdf3ec888d2/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L410)

Retries the request with low (non-blocking) priority. This is the
same as having passed `cacheOptions.backgroundReload = true` on the original
request.

This will not change the existing request's state. To subscribe
to the new request's state, use `getRequestState` on the returned
[Future](../../request/types/Future.md).

```ts
const future = state.reload();
const state = getRequestState(future);
```

It is safe to pass this around as an "action" or "event" handler
as its context is bound.

#### Parameters

##### usePolicy?

`boolean`

#### Returns

[`Future`](../../request/types/Future.md)<`RT`>

***

### reload()

```ts
reload(): Future<RT>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:392](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/61394c6234e8cd5b736138b64ac29fdf3ec888d2/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L392)

Retries the request with high (blocking) priority. This is the
same as having passed `cacheOptions.reload = true` on the original
request.

This will not change the existing request's state. To subscribe
to the new request's state, use `getRequestState` on the returned
[Future](../../request/types/Future.md).

```ts
const future = state.reload();
const state = getRequestState(future);
```

It is safe to pass this around as an "action" or "event" handler
as its context is bound.

#### Returns

[`Future`](../../request/types/Future.md)<`RT`>
