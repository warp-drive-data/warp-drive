```ts
const ENFORCE_STRICT_RESOURCE_FINALIZATION: boolean | null;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/build-config/src/canary-features.ts:156](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/84081dc1da3e764fc56a2cdce4df50ea41e2704c/warp-drive-packages/build-config/src/canary-features.ts#L156)

This upcoming feature adds a validation step when `schema.fields({ type })`
is called for the first time for a resource.

When active, if any trait specified by the resource or one of its traits is
missing an error will be thrown in development.
