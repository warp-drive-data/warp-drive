# &#x20;makeInitializer()

```ts
function makeInitializer(fn: () => unknown): Initializer;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/reactivity/internal.ts:27](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/2147c43395d4507f6b19c72a4b94f1d81379737b/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/reactivity/internal.ts#L27)

Wraps `fn` so that a signal can recognize it as a lazy initializer
for its value rather than the value itself, deferring the call to
`fn` until the signal is first accessed.

## Parameters

### fn

() => `unknown`

## Returns

`Initializer`
