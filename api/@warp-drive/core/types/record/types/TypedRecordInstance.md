Records may be anything, They don't even
have to be objects.

Whatever they are, if they have a Type

and WarpDrive to provide better type safety and
intellisense.

The type of the resource.

This is an optional feature that can be used by

When used, WarpDrive APIs can
take advantage of this to provide better type
