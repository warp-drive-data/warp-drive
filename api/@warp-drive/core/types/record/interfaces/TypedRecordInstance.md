Records may be anything, They don't even
have to be objects.

Whatever they are, if they have a Type
property, that property will be used by WarpDrive
and WarpDrive to provide better type safety and
intellisense.

The type of the resource.

This is an optional feature that can be used by
record implementations to provide a typescript
hint for the type of the resource.

When used, WarpDrive APIs can
take advantage of this to provide better type
safety and intellisense.
