[Cache](../types/Cache.md) Operations perform updates to the
Cache's "remote" (or clean) state to reflect external
changes.

Usually operations represent the result of a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) or
[ServerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventSource) message, though they can also be used to carefully
patch the state of the cache with information known by the
application or developer.

Operations are applied via [Cache.patch](../types/Cache.md#patch).

See also Mutation, which applies analogous updates to the
Cache's "local" (or dirty) state.
