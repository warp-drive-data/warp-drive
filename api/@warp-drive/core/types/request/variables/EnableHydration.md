# &#x20;EnableHydration

```ts
const EnableHydration: "___(unique) Symbol(EnableHydration)";
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/request.ts:45](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/7d14928562bb412c61b403e577095b9a3f9cb0b7/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/request.ts#L45)

A [RequestInfo](../types/RequestInfo.md) flag which, when set, signals to the store's
`instantiateRecord` hook that the resolved content should be hydrated
into reactive records rather than returned as raw data.
