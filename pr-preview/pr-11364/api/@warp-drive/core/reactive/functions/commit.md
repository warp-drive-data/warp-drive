  Forcibly makes an editable resource's local changes its new remote (immutable)
  state, bypassing a save round-trip.

# &#x20;commit()

```ts
function commit(record: ReactiveResource): Promise<void>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts:777](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/aa8c40f25a3a1b12e361ab01c9a1a96b8a21b86e/warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts#L777)

Forcibly commit all local changes on an editable resource to
the remote (immutable) version.

This API should only be used cautiously. Typically a better
approach is for either the API or a Handler to reflect saved
changes back to update the cache.

## Parameters

### record

[`ReactiveResource`](../types/ReactiveResource.md)

## Returns

[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<`void`>
