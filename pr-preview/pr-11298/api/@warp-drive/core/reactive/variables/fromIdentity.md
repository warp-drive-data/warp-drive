# &#x20;fromIdentity

```ts
const fromIdentity: FromIdentityDerivation;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/schema.ts:494](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/5de9f22d0492ddb5538f446e288d7623ead973ae/warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/schema.ts#L494)

A derivation that computes its value from the
record's identity.

It can be used via a derived field definition like:

```ts
{
  kind: 'derived',
  name: 'id',
  type: '@identity',
  options: { key: 'id' }
}
```

Valid keys are `'id'`, `'lid'`, `'type'`, and `'^'`.

`^` returns the entire identifier object.
