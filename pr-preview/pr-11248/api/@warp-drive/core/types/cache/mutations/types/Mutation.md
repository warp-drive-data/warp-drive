  | SortRelatedRecordsMutation;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/mutations.ts:171](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/f062a076bc8863498969a21610d42251c8546673/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/mutations.ts#L171)

A `Mutation` is an action that updates the local (uncommitted or "dirty")
state of the [Cache](../../types/Cache.md) in some manner.

Most Mutations are in theory also [Operations](../../operations/types/Operation.md); the
difference is that the change should be applied as local/dirty state
instead of as remote/clean state.

Mutations are applied via [Cache.mutate](../../types/Cache.md#mutate).
