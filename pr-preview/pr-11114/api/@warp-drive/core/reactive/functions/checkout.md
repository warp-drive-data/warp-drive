# &#x20;checkout()

```ts
function checkout<T>(resource): Promise<T & ReactiveResource>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts:755](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/2a894723a738725713417f2a39f20d1a3c698f73/warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts#L755)

Checkout an immutable resource for editing.

[ReactiveResources](../interfaces/ReactiveResource.md) are not editable by default. This method
creates an editable copy of the resource.

This returns a promise which resolves with the editable
version of the resource.

```ts
import { checkout } from '@warp-drive/core/reactive';

const immutable = store.peekRecord('user', '1');
const editable = await checkout(immutable);
```

Edits to editable resources will be automatically committed if a new
payload from the cache matches their existing value.

## Throws
