# &#x20;commit()

```ts
function commit(record: ReactiveResource): Promise<void>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts:802](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/d56108b6552caa25009474ead19f4e2b6cec590b/warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/record.ts#L802)

Forcibly commit all local changes on an editable resource to
the remote (immutable) version.

This covers both fields and relationships: the local state of
every relationship with uncommitted changes becomes its remote
state, and the inverses are updated to match.

This API should only be used cautiously. Typically a better
approach is for either the API or a Handler to reflect saved
changes back to update the cache.

## Parameters

### record

[`ReactiveResource`](../types/ReactiveResource.md)

## Returns

[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<`void`>
