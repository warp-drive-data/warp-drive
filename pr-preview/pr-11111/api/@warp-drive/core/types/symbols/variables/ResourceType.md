# &#x20;ResourceType

```ts
const ResourceType: "___(unique) Symbol($type)" = Type;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/symbols.ts:66](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/f4874b11d917637fc69e13d92cdd6e92ce16baa8/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/symbols.ts#L66)

Symbol for the type of a resource.

This is an optional feature that can be used by
record implementations to provide a typescript
hint for the type of the resource.

When used, WarpDrive APIs can
take advantage of this to provide better type
safety and intellisense.
