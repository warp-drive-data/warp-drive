When [op](#op) is `'upsert'`, the data to merge into the
cache for the entity.

This is opaque to the Store but should be understood by the Cache and
may be utilized by an Adapter when generating data during a `save`
operation.

It is generally recommended that `patch` contain only the updated
state, ignoring fields that are unchanged.
