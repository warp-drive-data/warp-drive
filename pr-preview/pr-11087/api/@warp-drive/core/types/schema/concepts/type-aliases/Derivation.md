# &#x20;Derivation\<R, T, FM>

```ts
type Derivation<R, T, FM> = object & (record, options, prop) => T;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/schema/concepts.ts:55](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/a37221ebf6a3775fa6d7b559641a9238e4f43660/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/schema/concepts.ts#L55)

A Derivation computes a read-only field value from other fields
(and options) on a record.

Derivations back DerivedField. They are memoized and only
recomputed when the fields they read change; derived values are never
stored in the cache nor sent to the server.

Derivations must be registered with the SchemaService via
`schema.registerDerivation(derivation)` before use, keyed by the
name assigned to their [Type](../../../symbols/variables/Type.md) property.

## Type Declaration

### \_\_\_(unique) Symbol($type)

```ts
___(unique) Symbol($type): string;
```

The unique name this derivation is registered under.

## Type Parameters

### R

`R` = `unknown`

### T

`T` = `unknown`

### FM

`FM` *extends* [`ObjectValue`](../../../json/raw/interfaces/ObjectValue.md) | `null` = [`ObjectValue`](../../../json/raw/interfaces/ObjectValue.md) | `null`
