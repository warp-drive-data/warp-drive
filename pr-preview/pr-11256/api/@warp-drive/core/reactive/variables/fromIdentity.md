# &#x20;fromIdentity

```ts
const fromIdentity: FromIdentityDerivation;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/schema.ts:497](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/c095d2e6f55c70ee964e1a33fb501af9507bd094/warp-drive-packages/core/src/reactive/-private/schema.ts#L497)

A derivation that computes its value from the
record's identity.

It can be used via a derived field definition like:

```ts
{
  kind: 'derived',
  name: 'id',
  type: '@identity',
  options: { key: 'id' }
}
```

Valid keys are `'id'`, `'lid'`, `'type'`, and `'^'`.

`^` returns the entire identifier object.
