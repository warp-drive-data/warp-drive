  Legacy `Model` base class and `attr`, `belongsTo`, and `hasMany` decorators
  that define resource schemas as classes and present records.
---

&#x20;

This package provides a Presentation Model for resource data in an WarpDrive Cache.

Models are defined as classes extending from `import Model from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';` and the
attributes and relationships on these classes are parsed at runtime to supply static "schema"
to WarpDrive's SchemaService.

Resource data for individual resources fetched from your API is presented to the UI via instances
of the `Model`s you define. An instantiated `Model` is referred to as a `record`.

When we refer to the `ModelClass` as opposed to a `Model` or `Record` we are referring
specifically to the class definition and the static schema methods present on it.

When we refer to a `record` we refer to a specific class instance presenting
the resource data for a given `type` and `id`.

### Why It's Legacy

The `Model` pattern uses class inheritance and decorators to define your data schema:

* The `attr`, `belongsTo` and `hasMany` decorators are Ember computed properties, and the
  schema is read at runtime by walking each Model class's computed properties.
* Every record is an instance of its own `Model` subclass, and `Model` extends `EmberObject`,
  which ties your data layer to Ember and its object model.

### Modern Alternative

Use **schemas** with `@warp-drive/core`. Modern ***Warp*Drive**:

* defines each resource's schema as a plain object, a `ResourceSchema`, registered with the
  store's SchemaService, with no class or decorators
* presents every resource type through one record implementation,
  [ReactiveResource](/api/@warp-drive/core/reactive/types/ReactiveResource), which reads
  its fields from the registered schema
* shares fields across schemas with [traits](/guides/the-manual/schemas/traits), and adds
  memoized read-only fields with [derivations](/guides/the-manual/schemas/derivations) and
  value conversions with [transformations](/guides/the-manual/schemas/transformations),
  instead of inheritance
* works in any framework ***Warp*Drive** supports, since `@warp-drive/core` has no runtime
  dependency on Ember (see [Installation](/guides/installation/))

For guidance on migrating from Model classes to schemas, see the
[Schemas Guide](/guides/the-manual/schemas/) and the [Migration Guide](/upgrading/v5/).

### Defining a Model

```js [app/models/person.js]
import Model, { attr, belongsTo, hasMany } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';

export default class PersonModel extends Model {
  @attr name;

  @belongsTo('pet', { inverse: 'owners', async: false }) dog;

  @hasMany('person', { inverse: 'friends', async: true }) friends;
}
```

### modelName convention

By convention, the name of a given model (its `type`) matches the name
of the file in the `app/models` folder and should be lowercase, singular
and dasherized.
