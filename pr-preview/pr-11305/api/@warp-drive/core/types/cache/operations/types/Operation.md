Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/operations.ts:302](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/cfb9e9917e57745bae3891bf6a907cb9bd5a4470/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/operations.ts#L302)

[Cache](../../types/Cache.md) Operations perform updates to the
Cache's "remote" (or clean) state to reflect external
changes.

Usually operations represent the result of a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) or
[ServerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventSource) message, though they can also be used to carefully
patch the state of the cache with information known by the
application or developer.

Operations are applied via [Cache.patch](../../types/Cache.md#patch).
