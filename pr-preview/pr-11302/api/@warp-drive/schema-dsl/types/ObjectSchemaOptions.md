  hash?: boolean;
}

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:14](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/efb887b3989a37a1b5644c05469fcfa30c38e5c4/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L14)

## Properties

### hash?

```ts
optional hash?: boolean;
```

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:22](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/efb887b3989a37a1b5644c05469fcfa30c38e5c4/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L22)

Reserved for future use. The compiled schema's `identity` is currently
determined solely by whether a property on the class is decorated with
[hash](#hash), not by this option.
