  Legacy alias that re-exports `RESTAdapter`, `fetchOptions`, and their request
  types from `@warp-drive/legacy/adapter/rest` so `@ember-data/adapter/rest`
  imports keep working.

:::warning Legacy package
`@ember-data/adapter` is a legacy package. Adapters are no longer encouraged; new code should use [Handlers](/api/@warp-drive/core/request/types/Handler) with the `RequestManager` from [`@warp-drive/core`](/api/@warp-drive/core/) instead.
:::

Legacy alias of [@warp-drive/legacy/adapter/rest](../../../@warp-drive/legacy/adapter/rest/index.md).
This entry re-exports the REST adapter from that module unchanged so existing
`@ember-data/adapter/rest` imports keep working; new code should import
from `@warp-drive/legacy/adapter/rest` directly.
