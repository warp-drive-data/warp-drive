# &#x20;SignalNode

```ts
interface SignalNode extends ReactiveNode {}
```

Defined in: [primitives.ts:55](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/2f9dd60e2e8475e54dc0b38deaf9c4a3da3adc17/warp-drive-packages/alien-signals/src/primitives.ts#L55)

A signal created by [createSignal](../functions/createSignal.md). It carries no value: it only records which memos and
watchers depend on it, so that [notifySignal](../functions/notifySignal.md) can tell them the value it guards changed.

Its fields belong to the graph and must not be read or written directly.
