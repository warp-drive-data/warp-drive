# &#x20;ObjectSchemaOptions

```ts
interface ObjectSchemaOptions {
  hash?: boolean;
}

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:14](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/8280ed61816b930e2f4b7b363858bbd832e09e17/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L14)

Options accepted by the [ObjectSchema](../functions/ObjectSchema.md) decorator.

## Properties

### hash?

```ts
optional hash?: boolean;
```

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:22](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/8280ed61816b930e2f4b7b363858bbd832e09e17/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L22)

Reserved for future use. The compiled schema's `identity` is currently
determined solely by whether a property on the class is decorated with
[hash](#hash), not by this option.
