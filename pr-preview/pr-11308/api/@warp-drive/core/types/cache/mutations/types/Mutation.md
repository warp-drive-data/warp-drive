# &#x20;Mutation

```ts
type Mutation = 
  | ReplaceRelatedRecordsMutation
  | ReplaceRelatedRecordMutation
  | RemoveFromResourceRelationshipMutation
  | AddToResourceRelationshipMutation
  | SortRelatedRecordsMutation;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/mutations.ts:193](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/8280ed61816b930e2f4b7b363858bbd832e09e17/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/cache/mutations.ts#L193)

A `Mutation` is an action that updates the local (uncommitted or "dirty")
state of the [Cache](../../types/Cache.md) in some manner.

Most Mutations are in theory also [Operations](../../operations/types/Operation.md); the
difference is that the change should be applied as local/dirty state
instead of as remote/clean state.

Mutations are applied via [Cache.mutate](../../types/Cache.md#mutate).
