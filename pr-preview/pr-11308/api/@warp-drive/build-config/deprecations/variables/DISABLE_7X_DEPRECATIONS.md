  Opt-in flag: set it to `false` to make deprecations backported from 6.x print
  and become resolvable; by default they stay silent and unresolvable.

:::warning Legacy package
`@warp-drive/build-config` is a legacy package. New code should use [`@warp-drive/core/build-config`](/api/@warp-drive/core/build-config/) instead.
:::

# &#x20;DISABLE\_7X\_DEPRECATIONS&#x20;

```ts
const DISABLE_7X_DEPRECATIONS: boolean = true;
```

Defined in: [deprecations.ts:571](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/8280ed61816b930e2f4b7b363858bbd832e09e17/warp-drive-packages/build-config/src/deprecations.ts#L571)

This is a special flag that can be used to opt-in early to receiving deprecations introduced in 6.x
which have had their infra backported to 5.x versions of ***Warp*Drive**.

When this flag is not present or set to `true`, the deprecations from the 6.x branch
will not print their messages and the deprecation cannot be resolved.

When this flag is present and set to `false`, the deprecations from the 6.x branch will
print and can be resolved.

## Until

7.0
