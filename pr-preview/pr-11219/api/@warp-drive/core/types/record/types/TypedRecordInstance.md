Records may be anything, They don't even
have to be objects.

Whatever they are, if they have a Type
property, that property will be used by WarpDrive
and WarpDrive to provide better type safety and
intellisense.

### \_\_\_(unique) Symbol($type)

```ts
___(unique) Symbol($type): string;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/record.ts:30](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/6638c699171a70d967515a5e333c695a52540144/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/record.ts#L30)

The type of the resource.

This is an optional feature that can be used by
record implementations to provide a typescript
hint for the type of the resource.

When used, WarpDrive APIs can
take advantage of this to provide better type
safety and intellisense.
