# &#x20;ConflictError

```ts
ConflictError: AdapterRequestErrorConstructor<ConflictError>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/adapter/error.ts:465](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/fe5df5abab153c45663c00dfcbcd8d5192080e20/warp-drive-packages/legacy/src/adapter/error.ts#L465)

A `ConflictError` equates to an HTTP `409 Conflict` response status.
It is used by an adapter to indicate that the request could not be
processed because of a conflict in the request. An example scenario
would be when creating a record with a client-generated ID but that ID
is already known to the external API.

An example use case would be to surface a conflict-specific message so
the user can retry with different input:

```js [app/routes/application.js]
import { ConflictError } from '@warp-drive/legacy/adapter/error';

export default class ApplicationRoute extends Route {
  @action
  error(error, transition) {
    if (error instanceof ConflictError) {
      alert('That identifier is already in use, please choose another.');
      return;
    }

    // ...other error handling logic
  }
}
```
