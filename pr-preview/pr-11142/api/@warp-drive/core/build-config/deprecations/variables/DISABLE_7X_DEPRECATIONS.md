# &#x20;DISABLE\_7X\_DEPRECATIONS&#x20;

```ts
const DISABLE_7X_DEPRECATIONS: boolean;
```

Defined in: [node\_modules/.pnpm/@warp-d\_25f56f2729dd79700790d78740333f27/node\_modules/@warp-drive/build-config/dist/deprecations.d.ts:529](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/fe5df5abab153c45663c00dfcbcd8d5192080e20/node_modules/.pnpm/@warp-d_25f56f2729dd79700790d78740333f27/node_modules/@warp-drive/build-config/dist/deprecations.d.ts#L529)

This is a special flag that can be used to opt-in early to receiving deprecations introduced in 6.x
which have had their infra backported to 5.x versions of ***Warp*Drive**.

When this flag is not present or set to `true`, the deprecations from the 6.x branch
will not print their messages and the deprecation cannot be resolved.

When this flag is present and set to `false`, the deprecations from the 6.x branch will
print and can be resolved.

## Until

7.0
