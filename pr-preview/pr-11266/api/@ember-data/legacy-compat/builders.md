  Deprecated request builders (`findAll`, `findRecord`, `query`, `queryRecord`,
  `saveRecord`) that move store method calls onto `store.request` while keeping
  adapter behavior.

:::warning Legacy package
`@ember-data/legacy-compat` is a legacy package. It bridges Models, Adapters, and Serializers to the `RequestManager` and cache; new code should skip it and start from [`@warp-drive/core`](/api/@warp-drive/core/) with schemas, Handlers, and request builders.
:::

Builders for migrating from `store` methods to `store.request`.

These builders enable you to migrate your codebase to using the correct syntax for `store.request` while temporarily preserving legacy behaviors.
This is useful for quickly upgrading an entire app to a unified syntax while a longer incremental migration is made to shift off of adapters and serializers.
To that end, these builders are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Ember Data.
