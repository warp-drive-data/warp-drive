  ⚡️ Simple, Fast HTTP Mocking for Tests: experimental mocking that makes real
  network requests and replays git-managed recordings, via `MockServerHandler`
  and the `GET`/`POST` helpers in `@warp-drive/holodeck/mock`.

:::danger 🛑 **CANARY ONLY** 🛑
**@warp-drive/holodeck** is still experimental
:::

* ⚡️ Real network requests
  * brotli compression
  * http/2
  * no CORS preflight requests
* 💜 Unparalleled DX
  * debug real network requests
  * every request is scoped to a test
  * run as many tests as desired simultaneously
* 🔥 Blazing Fast Tests
  * record your tests when you change them
  * replays from cache until you change them again
  * the cache is managed by git, so switching branches works seamlessly, and CI and
    rebases skip work that is already recorded
  * zero-work: setup work is skipped when in replay mode

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add -E @warp-drive/holodeck@canary
```
