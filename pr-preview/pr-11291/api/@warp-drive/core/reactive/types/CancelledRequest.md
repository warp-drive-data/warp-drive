Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:494](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/29ab359ab5e9593db23fe661b989f7544558d789/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L494)

The state of a request that was aborted before it settled.

A cancelled request has `status: 'cancelled'` and its `reason` is an
`AbortError`. `isError` is also `true`, as for a [RejectedRequest](RejectedRequest.md),
so check `status` or `isCancelled` to tell the two apart.

## Type Parameters

### RT

`RT`

### E

`E` *extends* [`StructuredErrorDocument`](../../types/request/types/StructuredErrorDocument.md) = [`StructuredErrorDocument`](../../types/request/types/StructuredErrorDocument.md)

## Methods

### refresh()

```ts
refresh(usePolicy?: boolean): Future<RT>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:530](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/29ab359ab5e9593db23fe661b989f7544558d789/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L530)

Retries the request with low (non-blocking) priority. This is the
same as having passed `cacheOptions.backgroundReload = true` on the original
request.

This will not change the existing request's state. To subscribe
to the new request's state, use `getRequestState` on the returned
[Future](../../request/types/Future.md).

```ts
const future = state.reload();
const state = getRequestState(future);
```

It is safe to pass this around as an "action" or "event" handler
as its context is bound.

#### Parameters

##### usePolicy?

`boolean`

#### Returns

[`Future`](../../request/types/Future.md)<`RT`>

***

### reload()

```ts
reload(): Future<RT>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts:512](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/29ab359ab5e9593db23fe661b989f7544558d789/warp-drive-packages/core/src/signals/request-state.ts#L512)

Retries the request with high (blocking) priority. This is the
same as having passed `cacheOptions.reload = true` on the original
request.

This will not change the existing request's state. To subscribe
to the new request's state, use `getRequestState` on the returned
[Future](../../request/types/Future.md).

```ts
const future = state.reload();
const state = getRequestState(future);
```

It is safe to pass this around as an "action" or "event" handler
as its context is bound.

#### Returns

[`Future`](../../request/types/Future.md)<`RT`>

## Properties

### ~~error~~&#x20;

```ts
error: E;
