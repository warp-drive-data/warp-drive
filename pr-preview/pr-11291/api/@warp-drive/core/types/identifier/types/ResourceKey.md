```ts
type ResourceKey<T extends string = string> = 
  | PersistedResourceKey<T>
| NewResourceKey<T>;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/identifier.ts:162](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/29ab359ab5e9593db23fe661b989f7544558d789/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/identifier.ts#L162)

A referentially stable object with a unique string (lid) that can be used
as a reference to data in the cache.

Every resource has a unique ResourceKey, and ResourceKeys may refer
to data that has never been loaded (for instance, in an async relationship).

The [Key Terminology](/guides/the-manual/caching/key-terms#resources) guide explains
the resources it identifies.

## Type Parameters

### T

`T` *extends* `string` = `string`
