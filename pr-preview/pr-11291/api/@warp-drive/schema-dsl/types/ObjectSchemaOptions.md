### hash?

```ts
optional hash?: boolean;
```

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:20](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/aed3f52874c34501c8eb0b5a5a50cc1fceaf02b9/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L20)

determined solely by whether a property on the class is decorated with
[hash](#hash), not by this option.
