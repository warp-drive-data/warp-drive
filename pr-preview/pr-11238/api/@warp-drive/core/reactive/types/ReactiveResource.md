object.

The [ResourceSchemas](/guides/the-manual/schemas/resources/) guide shows how to
define the schema it reads.

This class is not directly instantiable. To use it, you should
configure the store's `instantiateRecord` and `teardownRecord` hooks
with the matching hooks provided by this package.
