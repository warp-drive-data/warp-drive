# &#x20;ObjectSchemaOptions

```ts
interface ObjectSchemaOptions {
  hash?: boolean;
}

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:14](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/16266e84cb8f768b9368b912524789ccbce1d3b1/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L14)

## Properties

### hash?

```ts
hash?: boolean;
```

Defined in: [entities/object-schema.ts:22](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/16266e84cb8f768b9368b912524789ccbce1d3b1/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/entities/object-schema.ts#L22)

Reserved for future use. The compiled schema's `identity` is currently
determined solely by whether a property on the class is decorated with
[hash](#hash), not by this option.
