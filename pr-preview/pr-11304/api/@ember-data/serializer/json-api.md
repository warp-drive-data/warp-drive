  Legacy alias that re-exports `JSONAPISerializer` from
  `@warp-drive/legacy/serializer/json-api` so `@ember-data/serializer/json-api`
  imports keep working.

:::warning Legacy package
`@ember-data/serializer` is a legacy package. Serializers are no longer encouraged; new code should use [Handlers](/api/@warp-drive/core/request/types/Handler) with the `RequestManager` from [`@warp-drive/core`](/api/@warp-drive/core/) instead.
:::

Legacy alias of [@warp-drive/legacy/serializer/json-api](../../../@warp-drive/legacy/serializer/json-api/index.md).
This entry re-exports the JSON:API serializer from that module unchanged so existing
`@ember-data/serializer/json-api` imports keep working; new code should import
from `@warp-drive/legacy/serializer/json-api` directly.
