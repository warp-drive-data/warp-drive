# &#x20;ResourceSchema

```ts
type ResourceSchema = 
  | PolarisResourceSchema
  | LegacyResourceSchema;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/schema/fields.ts:2410](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/7eaf148e53e5f6ffa145a9b2a3ce2c33c09608f8/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/schema/fields.ts#L2410)

A type which represents a valid JSON schema
definition for either a PolarisMode or a
LegacyMode resource.

Note, this is separate from the type returned
by the SchemaService which provides fields as a Map
instead of as an Array.
